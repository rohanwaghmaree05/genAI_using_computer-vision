Generative AI Using Computer Vision

Overview:
- This project explores Generative AI techniques applied to computer vision through three distinct practicals.
- It involves creating and manipulating visual content using advanced AI models and algorithms.

Features:
1. Generative Models: Implementing AI models for generating and modifying images.
2. Computer Vision Techniques: Applying computer vision algorithms to enhance and analyze the generated content.
3. Practical Exercises: Three practicals showcasing different applications of generative AI in computer vision.
   
Practicals:
- Practical 1: Computer Vision with Generativa AI
- Practical 2: Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) with Generativa AI
- Practical 3: Without Matplotlib Visualization
- Practical 4: Video Capturing using OpenCV

Key Technologies:
1. Python: Programming language used for implementing AI models and computer vision algorithms.
2. TensorFlow/PyTorch: Libraries for building and training generative models.
3. OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks.
4. Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries for visualizing results and model performance.
5. Jupyter Notebook: Environment for running and documenting the analysis.
